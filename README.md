# c++-code
simple c++ code with oops concept with the use of classes,object and inheritence
🔹 Description
This project is a C++ based Hybrid Calculator developed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, especially inheritance.
The program is divided into multiple classes:
A Simple Calculator class that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
A Scientific Calculator class that includes advanced mathematical operations.
A Hybrid Calculator class that inherits functionalities from both the Simple and Scientific Calculator classes, demonstrating multiple inheritance in C++.
This project helps in understanding class structure, inheritance, code reusability, and OOP principles in a practical way. It is suitable for beginners and students learning C++ and object-oriented programming.
🔹 Technologies Used
C++
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
🔹 Features
Implementation of Simple Calculator operations
Implementation of Scientific Calculator operations
Hybrid Calculator using inheritance
Clear demonstration of OOP and code reusability
🔹 Purpose
The purpose of this project is to practice C++ OOP concepts, especially inheritance and multiple inheritance, through a real-world calculator application.
